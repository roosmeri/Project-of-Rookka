## How to use

The project is a Django application. One must clone this repo and run the application with the command: 
  $python3 manage.py runserver 
from the upper RookkaSite directory. 
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/RookkaProject/ with one's browser. The site should show an input box and search button. Write your query words to the box and "Try your luck!". The titles and a tiny caption of the articles that contain the query words in title or text will show on the site.
