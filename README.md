# Project of Rookka
Course LG211 fall 2017, Building NLP Applications

## 

Riikka Raatikainen, Riina Juurmaa and Roosa Meril√§inen

## How to use

The project is a Django application. One must clone this repo and run the application with the command: 
$python3 manage.py runserver 
from the upper RookkaSite directory. 
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/RookkaProject/ with one's browser. The site should show the text: "Hello, visitor. You're at the RookkaProject's index." Hopefully something smarter in the future.
