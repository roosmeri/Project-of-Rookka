# Project of Rookka
Course LG211 fall 2017, Building NLP Applications

## 

Riikka Raatikainen, Riina Juurmaa and Roosa Meril√§inen

## How to use

The project is a Django application. One must clone this repo and run the application with the command: 
$python3 manage.py runserver 
from the upper RookkaSite directory. 
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/RookkaProject/ with one's browser. The site should show an input box and search button, hopefully quite soon entering words into the query box and clicking 'Search' will bring out some search result.
